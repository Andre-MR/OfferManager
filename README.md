## :page_with_curl:	About the project
Private project, requested by an e-commerce affiliate marketer, with their authorization to publish the source code.

The system is structured with a REST API in Node.js with a layered architecture of responsibility.
Using MySQL to store data created by the user.
A simple html/javascript frontend, which consumes the Bootstrap library and the Bootstrap Table table generator with a minimalist style.
All aiming at good usability, ensuring efficiency and simplicity for hosting on low-cost shared servers.

<!-- USAGE -->
## :desktop_computer:	Basic usage
These are basic usage information.
* The user opens url and is asked about a password. No user needed, it's a private single-user system for now.
* Password is saved in browser's local storage and will be used every time a request is sent by javascript code.
* A basic data list is sent from database.
* User can work with data populated to table, with many filters and ordering options.
* User can add new offer using a button that opens a popup window.
* User can edit offers already stored by clicking on them, editing and saving changes.
* Every time user edit and save an offer, its utilization time is changed and content text is copied to clipboard, to use with external publish software.
* Default sort order is by utilization date from older to most recent, because the point is priority to older offers.

The direct use is minimal, just because the page is mainly dinamically filled by Bootstrap Table with their own style options.

It's intended to be used exclusively as a datasheet with a desktop computer, but can be used with Android devices.
#### :earth_americas:	Language
User interface is all in Brazilian Portuguese. On the other hand, all code is in English.
